HEAR4YOU – SHAASTRA 26 SOCIAL CAMPAIGN

Hear4You is Shaastra’26’s social campaign, initiated with a simple
question: how many people struggle to hear yet go unnoticed?

Hearing health is often ignored until it becomes irreversible, even
though most cases are preventable. Hear4You aims to break this silence
by spreading awareness early, building empathy, and creating support
systems so that hearing disability never becomes a barrier to
communication, dignity, or opportunity.

Over recent months, the campaign has taken meaningful steps. One
initiative, Hear2Heart, brought students from Clarke School for the Deaf
to IIT Madras for a day of shared activities and connection.

Indian Sign Language Day was celebrated in collaboration with the Hear
Million Foundation, bringing together nearly 500 deaf participants. The
event featured ISL performances, cultural showcases, and stalls run by
deaf-led businesses.

The Hear4You 5K Run became the campaign’s largest public engagement
event, bringing participants together in an act of awareness and
solidarity. Flagged off by Jerlin Anika, a three-time Deaflympics
badminton gold medalist and Arjuna Awardee, the run sparked
conversations around hearing health and accessibility.

ANIMAL AND ENVIRONMENT SAFETY Savings for the future:

The biodiversity seen on our campus is under severe pressure due to
activities like construction, increasing human population, and
increasing non-biodegradable waste. Every year, the forest area in our
campus is shrinking further. To ensure this beautiful forest exists for
future generations, collective responsibility and conscious living are
essential.

Drive slowly and carefully inside the campus. Do not tease or hurt
wildlife inside the campus.

Encourage children to be compassionate and caring.

Do not use slings, crackers, snares or any methods to frighten, hurt or
injure animals. If you see anyone involved in such acts, discourage them
and report the incident. Almost all forms of wildlife on campus are
protected under the Wildlife Protection Act.

Avoid using vehicles inside the campus for short distances, as it
increases pollution with minimal benefit.
