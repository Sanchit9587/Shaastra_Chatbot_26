Protein Biophysics Lab

Our research areas are broadly classified as:

1. Experimental Characterization of Protein Conformational Behaviour and its Relation to Function: Our primary aim is to understand the mapping of protein sequence onto the structure and hence onto the function. Since protein function is the overriding force that drives the evolution of protein sequences, we are currently studying a collection of homologous transcription factors (both ordered and disordered) to identify the extent to which function and its structural requirements influence the folding mechanistic features of proteins.

2. Modelling and Predicting Folding Landscapes using Statistical Models: Protein folding studies, however complex, are typically interpreted with simple two state or three-state chemical models. On the other hand, theoretical treatments of folding point to the fact that the polymeric chain can sample multitudes of conformations (microstates) and that the folded-functional structure is just one among many that could be populated. It is of course possible that this complexity has been simplified through natural selection, thus eventually resulting in a simple two-state or three-state-like folding. But trying to understand folding mechanisms from these chemical models would trivialize the problem and hide the mapping of sequence patterning on the folding features. We are currently building a web server that takes solely the protein structure as input and predicts multiple folding-related features using this model (in a few hours). Experimentalists could employ the output to better understand the folding mechanism, fine-tune their experiments, or identify novel avenues in their approaches.

3. Understanding Protein Folding and Dynamics through Simulations: We perform both conventional and replica-exchange molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of proteins (thanks to GROMACS). Because they are time-consuming, we are currently employing them as tools to validate the predictions of statistical models in cases where experiments are not immediately possible and to also look for any consistency with experimental results. We perform coarse-grained (CG) simulations (thanks to the SMOG web server) to improve sampling and to obtain seed points for atomistic MD. We have recently shown that CG simulations are powerful enough, if carefully calibrated against experimental observables, to identify partially structured states that are functionally relevant, i.e. evidence for the mechanism of conformational selection in binding"
